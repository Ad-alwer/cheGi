# cheGi Project Rules

## Project Identity

- cheGi slogan: **"The ultimate Git companion. Type less, do more."**
- Always use this exact slogan when describing the project — never make up or rephrase it

## Commits & Messages

- Every commit MUST use `conventional commits`: `type(scope): message`
- Types: `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `refactor` (rewrite), `chore` (chores), `docs` (documentation), `test` (tests), `ci` (CI/CD), `style` (formatting)
- Scopes: `scan`, `guard`, `sync`, `reword`, `setup`, `gitignore`, `config`, `build`
- Example: `fix(guard): escape file names in displayed command`
- Keep commits small and focused — one concern per commit

## Documentation Updates

- Every feature change (add/modify/remove) MUST update relevant docs in `docs/`
- CLI command change → update `docs/commands/<command>.md`
- Config change → update `docs/configuration.md`
- Security behavior change → update `docs/security.md`
- After doc changes, run `mkdocs build --strict` to verify links

## Version Management

- Single source of truth: `pyproject.toml` has the canonical version
- `src/chegi/__init__.py` reads version dynamically via `importlib.metadata`
- Never hardcode version in `__init__.py` — always read from metadata

## Workflow Rules

- Never commit, push, or create PRs unless explicitly asked by the user
- Present changes for review before committing
- After approval, stage and commit only when told to

## Changelog

- Update `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format) with each notable change
- Every version bump needs a new dated entry in CHANGELOG.md

## Testing

- Every change in `services/` needs new/updated tests
- Every CLI change needs `CliRunner` tests
- Before commit: `pytest -v` (all pass)
- Before commit: `ruff check src tests` (no errors)
- Before commit: `ruff format src tests` (no issues)

## Architecture

- CLI layer (`cli/commands/`) must be thin — business logic in `services/`
- Each service module has its own `models.py` (dataclasses), `exceptions.py`, `constants.py`
- Never use `subprocess.run` directly in services — use `GitClient.run_command()`
- Never use `shell=True` — always use command lists and `shlex`
- Don't replace environment variables — merge with `os.environ.copy()`

## Security

- Never `shell=True` in `subprocess.run` (except truly necessary with controlled input)
- All user input must be validated before use in shell/git/sed
- File names must always be quoted with `shlex.quote()`
- Never `except Exception: pass` — catch specific exceptions

## Code Style

- Type hints for all parameters and return values
- One-line docstrings for functions
- Double quotes (matching `pyproject.toml` config)
- Max line length: 88
- Variables/functions: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
